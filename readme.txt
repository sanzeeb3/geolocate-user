Stores geolocation data of WordPress users. Displays google map and allows user to mark their location via goolge map integration on their profile.

== Description ==

### 1) Default Geolocation Data:

### 2) Google Maps Marker:

The plugin also uses google maps API. The Maps JavaScript API lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on WordPress user profile page. The Maps JavaScript API features four basic map types (roadmap, satellite, hybrid, and terrain) which you can modify using layers and styles, controls and events, and various services and libraries.

To use the google marker, you must get an API key and insert the API in plugins settings page. The API key is used to track API requests associated with your project for usage and billing. Here's getting started with google maps API: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform


### 2.1) Collective Marker:

Allows all users to add their geolocation into a single map. Helpful to view geolocation of all users at once. All the users will have the capability to view and mark the map under Geolocate User Menu while only adminstrators will have capability to change settings.
